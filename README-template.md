## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
  Used <main> for the container to contain QR image and the text . <img> and <div> for QR image and the text respectively. Then inside that <div> added a <h3> heading and a paragraph to differentiate the text. Positioned correctly and then aligned to center.

### What I learned

   - Using semantic elements like <main>,<footer> instead of non-semantic markup like <div>,etc. provides more accessibility and organization to the page.

   - When "margin:auto" is not working to center the element , give the "text-align:center" property to the parent container for ex.body and then use "margin: 0 auto" in that particular element , this will successfully horizontally centers the element. Every single thing matters for a beginner ðŸ˜‰.

### Continued development

 - I definitely want to continue to focus on HTML and CSS ADVANCED as I'm still a newbie and I haven't yet got to know the different technologies and tools .
